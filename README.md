# OpenAQ Data Pipeline Project

A mini-project for practicing end-to-end data engineering workflows, including API integration, data wrangling and visualization.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses the [OpenAQ API](https://docs.openaq.org/) to extract air quality data (e.g., PM2.5, PM10) for selected cities or regions. The goal is to demonstrate:

- API integration using Python
- Data cleaning and transformation with pandas
- Data ETL with Google Cloud BigQuery
- Exploratory analysis and visualization
- Clean project structure with Git and virtual environments

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, requests, matplotlib/seaborn
- Git + GitHub
- Google BigQuery

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openaq-data-pipeline.git
   cd openaq-data-pipeline
    ```
